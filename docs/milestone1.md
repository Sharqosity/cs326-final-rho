## <ins>Innovative Idea</ins>
We're creating a website that allows users to create and view impromptu events on campus. For example, a user could login and create an event for a pick-up ultimate frisbee game at the campus pond. Other users would be able to view the location on a map and rsvp to say if they are coming. Events will also be labeled by their capacity for social distancing, allowing users to socialize and engage with their community while still staying safe.

## <ins> Important Components</ins>
* Create events - specifying date/time, location, link to external event page, capacity, and social distancing guidelines
* View events - on a large map of campus, the weather on that day, RSVP to join, or 'watch' to set a reminder without RSVP
* Sharing/inviting users to events, as well as an easy way for users to discover events






### Create Event Page
Purpose: The Create Event Page is the primary way for users to easily create events and share them with other users. It offers a wide variety of options
such as capacity choices, allowing for pin-dropping locations on a map, and other event-related details.

### Map Page
Purpose:The purpose of the Map Page is so that users can view all the events on campus on a single map. Additionally, this page offers 
users the ability to filter events by geographic locations.

### Profile Page
Purpose: The purpose of the Profile Page is so that the user can easily view all the events they are involved in. It allows the user
to see all of the events setup by them and make edits/remove them. Additionally, it also allows users to view all of the events they have joined
and remove themselves from it.
