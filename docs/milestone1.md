## <ins>Innovative Idea</ins>
We're creating a website that allows users to create and view impromptu events on campus. For example, a user could login and create an event for a pick-up ultimate frisbee game at the campus pond. Other users would be able to view the location on a map and rsvp to say if they are coming. Events will also be labeled by their capacity for social distancing, allowing users to socialize and engage with their community while still staying safe.

## <ins> Important Components</ins>
* Create events - specifying date/time, location, link to external event page, capacity, and social distancing guidelines
* View events - location on a map, the weather on that day, RSVP to join, or 'watch' to set a reminder without RSVP
* Sharing/inviting users to events, as well as an easy way for users to discover events
